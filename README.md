# DADI API Data Connector

This repository specifies the interface required to build a database connector for DADI API.

## Exports

Data connectors must export a constructor function at the root level. The constructor receives an optional object with config parameter overrides, and it should have the following methods in its prototype chain.

```js
const MyDataConnector = function (options) {
  this.config = Object.assign({}, config, options)
}

MyDataConnector.prototype.connect = function ({database, collection}) {
  // ...
}

module.exports = MyDataConnector
```

## Methods

- [`connect()`](#connectdatabase-collection)
- [`find()`](#find-query-collection-options---schema-settings-)
- [`insert()`](#insertdata-collection-options---schema-settings--)
- [`update()`](#updatequery-collection-update-options---schema)
- [`delete()`](#deletequery-collection-schema)
- [`stats()`](#statscollection-options)
- [`index()`](#indexcollection-indexes)
- [`getIndexes()`](#getindexescollection)
- [`dropDatabases()`](#dropdatabasecollection)

### `connect({database, collection})`

Establishes a connection to the database. API calls it both when establishing a connection for the first time and also when attempting a reconnection.

**Parameters:**
  - `database` {String}: the name of the database file to use
  - `collection` {Object}: the name of the collection to use
  
**Return value:**
- `Promise` resolved with `undefined` if the connection is successful
- `Promise` rejected with an `Error` object, with a message of `DB_DISCONNECTED`, if the connection could not be established

**Events emitted:**
- `DB_CONNECTED`: when the database connection is established
- `DB_ERROR`: when the database connection is closed or times out; an optional error object can be sent as a parameter
- `DB_RECONNECTED`: when the database connection is re-established

---

### `find({ query, collection, options = {}, schema, settings })`

Finds documents in a collection.

**Parameters:**
- `query` {Object}: the query to perform
- `collection` {String}: the name of the collection to query
- `options` {QueryOptions}: a set of query options, such as offset, limit, sort, fields
- `schema` {Object}: the JSON schema for the collection
- `settings` {Object}: the settings block of the collection schema

**Return value:**
- `Promise` resolved with an object containing:
  - `results`: An array with the matching documents
  - `metadata`: A metadata object, with the format used by [@dadi/metadata](https://github.com/dadi/metadata)
- `Promise` rejected with an `Error` object, with a message of `DB_DISCONNECTED`, if the connection to the database is unavailable

---

### `insert({data, collection, options = {}, schema, settings = {}})`

Creates documents in a collection.

**Parameters:**
- `data` {Object}: a single document or an Array of documents to insert
- `collection` {String}: the name of the collection to query
- `schema` {Object}: the JSON schema for the collection
- `settings` {Object}: the settings block of the collection schema

**Return value:**
- `Promise` resolved with an object containing an array with the inserted documents
- `Promise` rejected with an `Error` object, with a message of `DB_DISCONNECTED`, if the connection to the database is unavailable

---

### `update({query, collection, update, options = {}, schema})`

Updates documents in a collection.

**Parameters:**
- `query` {Object}: the query that selects documents for update
- `collection` {String}: the name of the collection to update
- `update` {Object}: the update for the documents matching the query
- `options` {QueryOptions}: a set of query options, such as offset, limit, sort, fields
- `schema` {Object}: the JSON schema for the collection

**Return value:**
- `Promise` resolved with an object containing a `matchedCount` property, with a count of the number of documents affected by the update operation
- `Promise` rejected with an `Error` object, with a message of `DB_DISCONNECTED`, if the connection to the database is unavailable

---

### `delete({query, collection, schema})`

Deletes documents from a collection.

**Parameters:**
- `query` {Object}: the query that selects documents for deletion
- `collection` {String}: the name of the collection to delete from
- `schema` {Object}: the JSON schema for the collection

**Return value:**
- `Promise` resolved with an object containing a `deletedCount` property, with a count of the number of documents affected by the delete operation
- `Promise` rejected with an `Error` object, with a message of `DB_DISCONNECTED`, if the connection to the database is unavailable

---

### `stats(collection, options)`

Gets statistics about the collection.

**Parameters:**
- `collection` {String}: the name of the collection to get stats for
- `options` {QueryOptions}: a set of query options, such as offset, limit, sort, fields

**Return value:**
- `Promise` resolved with an object containing the following properties:
  - `count`
  - `size`
  - `averageObjectSize`
  - `storageSize`
  - `indexes`
  - `totalIndexSize`
  - `indexSizes`
- `Promise` rejected with an `Error` object, with a message of `DB_DISCONNECTED`, if the connection to the database is unavailable

---

### `index(collection, indexes)`

Creates indexes in the collection.

**Parameters:**
- `collection` {String}: the name of the collection to add indexes to
- `indexes` {Object}: an array of indexes to create for the collection

**Return value:**
- `Promise` resolved with an array of objects representing the indexes, with the name of the collection and the name of the index in the `collection` and `index` properties respectively
- `Promise` rejected with an `Error` object, with a message of `DB_DISCONNECTED`, if the connection to the database is unavailable

---

### `getIndexes(collection)`

Retrieves indexes from a collection.

**Parameters:**
- `collection` {String}: the name of the collection to get indexes for

**Return value:**
- `Promise` resolved with an array of objects representing the indexes, each with the name of the index in an `name` property
- `Promise` rejected with an `Error` object, with a message of `DB_DISCONNECTED`, if the connection to the database is unavailable

---

### `dropDatabase(collection)`

Removes a collection from a database or drops the database completely.

**Parameters:**
- `collection` {String}: the name of the collection to drop from the database. Use `null` to drop the database.

**Return value:**
- `Promise` resolved with `undefined`
- `Promise` rejected with an `Error` object, with a message of `DB_DISCONNECTED`, if the connection to the database is unavailable

## Configuration

DADI API uses one primary configuration file to modify the behaviour of certain functions. In addition to the primary configuration file it also needs a configuration file for the data connector that is being used.

### Configuration Files

The configuration files for your API Connector must be placed in the same directory as the primary API configuration file, which is commonly `config/`.

The naming convention for API Connector configuration files follows the format `nameOfConnector.<environment>.json`

For example:

* nameOfConnector.development.json
* nameOfConnector.test.json
* nameOfConnector.production.json

The configuration file should contain an configurable properties that a user needs to connect to and configure the underlying data store.

For example:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 2101,
    "autosaveInterval": 1000
  }
}
```
